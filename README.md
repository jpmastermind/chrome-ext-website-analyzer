# Website Analyzer
## _Chrome Extension Website Analyzer_

This easy-to-use extension will help you analyze any website for performance or SEO issues via a series of online tools specialized for that use.

Available online tools are:
- downforeveryoneorjustme.com
- siteworthtraffic.com
- similarweb.com
- gtmetrix.com

Note that there is no affiliation with those online services. This extension is simply a redirection tool to useful SEO websites, using the current tab's URL as prefilled URL.

Please don't hesitate to report bugs, request new features, or fork the project to improve it.

You can use this extension on [**Chrome web store**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/website-analyzer/bdcckjclnahikonjlldbedlecjilopjd).
